+ Project summary: The goal of this project was to create an OCR post-processing procedure to enhance Tesseract OCR output. Unfortunately, my teammates had varying levels of commitment to this project, and all ultimated decided not to contribute work to this project. The files included in this repo cover the tasks that were assigned to me, including generating the set of features detailed in paper D3, fitting/tuning an SVM using these features, and writing function to compute character-level differences. Another member of my team planned to write all data cleaning scripts. However, as this work was not completed, I have fit two seperate models, one using data with class-labels generated by checking wether or not a term was included in a standard spell-check dictionary, and another using data that was produced by a teammate, but cannot be verified as we are no longer in contact. Greater details can be found in main.Rmd and the /data folder README. I have also included the set of slides I wrote, which cover my work on the error correction model, adjustments made to the algorithm, suggestions for model improvment as well as an overview of the project objective and my personal experience with OCR softwares.
